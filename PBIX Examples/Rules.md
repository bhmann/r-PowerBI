<h1>Rules for sharing PBIX Reports:</h1>
<ul>
<li> All reports must be open and public </li>
<li>Do not include any personally identifiable or proprietary data. If you are looking for dummy datasets to use that don't contain proprietary data, visit: https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets</li>
<li>All reports should include the raw data necessary to interact with the file. We suggest connecting to a live data-set, rather than a CSV or XSLX that is hosted locally on your laptop.</li>
<li>As these reports are mostly used for learning and demonstrations, please consider adding text boxes, titles, and other useful information that documents what you did and why you did it</li>

</ul>
